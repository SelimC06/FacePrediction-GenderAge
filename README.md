# ðŸ‘¤ Face Prediction (Gender & Age)

This project uses **OpenCV** and a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces from a webcam and predict both **gender** and **age** in real time.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Detects faces using OpenCV.  
- Predicts **gender** (male/female).  
- Predicts **age group** (e.g., 0â€“2, 4â€“6, 8â€“12, etc.).  
- Works in real-time with a webcam feed.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- Pre-trained Caffe/TensorFlow models (included in the repo).  

Install dependencies:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
